STUFF TO DO:
- better backup   -- Penta: +1 (multiple different types of backups to ensure nothing gets lost when the base game backup happens at a bad timing)

- angles dial (spin over the limit)
	buttons for multiplying?


Mod Config:


Party Tricks:
- swap color channels? (tags!!!)
- in-editor code evaluator
- gif in imgui (Are you sure? :skull:)


EA FIX:
- lively cranky (not even possible anymore?)
- level select non levels/folders
- expand whitelist with new params   -- Penta: don wanna


Low Priority:   -- Penta: very low priority, like in will get implemented next year, if at all
- hold dragging customization
- replay system (worked on by someone else?)
- ctrl select (worked on by someone else?)
- sfx for selecting events (more info required)
- default positions for imgui windows (too lazy)


Potential:   -- Penta: i have no idea if i will even implement these features
- better level duplicate scan + auto .redirect conversion + updates redirects with folder rename/move
- move player in editor (i see no use)
- overlap warning with ease durations (blue durations for eases with same var kinda cover this)
- ease tooltips/descriptions (too much work)
- auto convert when fakeRepeat is off and event is selected (annoying to make)
