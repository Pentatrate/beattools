STUFF TO DO:
- better backup   -- Penta: +1 (multiple different types of backups to ensure nothing gets lost when the base game backup happens at a bad timing)

- ease search bar
- calculator
- bundle multiple eases together
- demo notif (rand working on it)
- restart on acc?
- different saves for different accessibility settings
- level select non levels/folders
- ease tooltips/descriptions (too much work)
- imgui size problem
- tooltipmarker replacing


Utilitools:
- imguihelpers: ease tooltips
- keybinds
- time


Party Tricks:
- swap color channels? (tags!!!)
- gif in imgui (Are you sure? :skull:)


EA FIX:
- expand whitelist with new params   -- Penta: don wanna


Low Priority:   -- Penta: very low priority, like in will get implemented next year, if at all
- angles dial (spin over the limit)
- - buttons for multiplying?
- hold dragging customization
- sfx for selecting events (more info required)
- default positions for imgui windows (too lazy)
- auto update event groups?
- lively cranky (not even possible anymore?) (kak)
- fake repeat copy paste bug???????????????????????????????????????? cannot recreate


Potential:   -- Penta: i have no idea if i will even implement these features
- maybe see original channel colors in channel preview
- better level duplicate scan + auto .redirect conversion + updates redirects with folder rename/move
- move player in editor (i see no use)
- overlap warning with ease durations (blue durations for eases with same var kinda cover this)
- auto convert when fakeRepeat is off and event is selected (annoying to make)
