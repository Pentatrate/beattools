TODO:
- better backup   -- Penta: +1 (multiple different types of backups to ensure nothing gets lost when the base game backup happens at a bad timing)

- calculator
- bundle multiple eases together
- different saves for different accessibility settings

- imgui size problem
- tooltipmarker replacing

- default positions for imgui windows (too lazy)


Utilitools:
- imguihelpers: ease tooltips
- hold keybinds
- time
- suggest separate


Later:
- angles dial (spin over the limit)
- - buttons for multiplying?
- fake repeat copy paste bug???????????????????????????????????????? cannot recreate
- ease tooltips/descriptions (too much work)


Potential:
- expand whitelist with new params   -- Penta: don wanna
- lively cranky (not even possible anymore?) (kak)
- auto update event groups?
- demo notif (rand working on it)
- restart on acc?


Party Tricks:
- sfx (more info required)
- better level duplicate scan + auto .redirect conversion + updates redirects with folder rename/move
