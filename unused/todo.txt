TODO:
- better backup   -- Penta: +1 (multiple different types of backups to ensure nothing gets lost when the base game backup happens at a bad timing)

- calculator
- bundle multiple eases together

- tooltipmarker replacing
- default positions for imgui windows (too lazy)

- "r" non snap adjusting

- Use better time detection for undo


Utilitools:
- hold keybinds
- suggest words separated by space
- fold all
- optionslist


Later:
- fake repeat copy paste bug? cannot recreate
- ease tooltips/descriptions (too much work)
- different score saves for different accessibility settings


Potential:
- expand whitelist with new params   -- Penta: don wanna
- lively cranky (not even possible anymore?) (kak)
- auto update event groups?
- restart on acc?


Party Tricks:
- sfx (more info required)
- better level duplicate scan + auto .redirect conversion + updates redirects with folder rename/move
